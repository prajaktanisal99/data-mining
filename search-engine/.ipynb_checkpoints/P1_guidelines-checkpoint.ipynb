    "(7.3) If a document $d$ appears in the top-10 elements of every query token, calculate $d$'s cosine similarity score. Recall that the score is defined as follows. Since $d$ appears in top-10 of all query tokens, we have all the information to calculate its actual score $sim(q,d)$.\n",

    "(7.4) If a document $d$ doesn't appear in the top-10 elements of some query token $t$, use the weight in the 10th element as the upper-bound on $t$'s weight in $d$'s vector. Hence, we can calculate the upper-bound score for $d$ using the query tokens' actual and upper-bound weights with respect to $d$'s vector, as follows. \n",

As a special case, for a document $d$ that doesn't appear in the top-10 elements of any query token $t$, its upper-bound score is thus: \n",
